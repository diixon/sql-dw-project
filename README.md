## 🧭 Project Overview

**SQL Data Warehouse Project** is an end-to-end SQL Server project that demonstrates how to build a modern data warehouse using the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)**.

The project covers the complete data warehousing workflow, including:

- Ingesting raw CRM and ERP data from CSV files
- Loading data into the Bronze layer
- Cleaning, standardizing, and transforming data in the Silver layer
- Building analytical views in the Gold layer using a dimensional model
- Validating data quality with automated SQL checks

This repository serves as a practical portfolio project for data engineering and data analytics, showcasing ETL development, data modeling, SQL best practices, and data quality validation.

## ✨ Features

- **Complete Medallion Pipeline** – Implements the Bronze → Silver → Gold architecture, from raw CSV ingestion to analytical views.
- **Idempotent & Re-runnable** – Scripts can be safely re-executed by dropping/recreating objects or truncating tables before loading.
- **CRM & ERP Integration** – Combines six source datasets from CRM and ERP systems into a unified data warehouse.
- **Robust Bronze Loading** – Uses `BULK INSERT` with progress logging, execution timing, and `TRY...CATCH` error handling.
- **Comprehensive Silver Transformations** – Includes data cleansing, deduplication, code mapping, data type conversions, date validation, business rule enforcement, ERP ID standardization, and proper-case formatting.
- **Analytics-Ready Gold Layer** – Provides two dimension views (`dim_customers`, `dim_products`) and one fact view (`fact_sales`) using a star schema for BI and reporting.
- **Built-in Data Quality Validation** – SQL quality checks verify duplicates, referential integrity, data consistency, and business rules with clear PASS/FAIL/WARN results.
- **Production-Oriented Design** – Includes configurable file paths, detailed execution logs, error handling, and guidance for safe execution.
